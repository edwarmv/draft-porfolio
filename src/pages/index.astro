    <p class="mb-4">
      Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated by how things work. My journey
      began in 2016 when I started studying computer science, where I learned
      the basics of programming and how computers operate and communicate. Since
      then, I've continued to explore web technologies on my own and remain
      committed to that path.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a skilled developer who enjoys challenges and isn't afraid to try new
      things.
