      <p class="mb-4">
        Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated by how things work. My
        journey began in 2016 when I started studying computer science, where I
        learned the basics of programming and how computers operate and
        communicate. Since then, I've continued to explore web technologies on
        my own and remain committed to that path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a skilled developer who enjoys challenges and isn't afraid to try
        new things.
